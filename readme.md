# zines as a loving practice of abolition
**Zines as a loving practice of abolition** is a workshop which presupposes zines as a technology or tool for sharing information, building and maintaining networks of affinity or larger sociopolitical movements. We can feel the affect of zines in their capacity to serve as resources for vulnerable and oppressed communities; communicate through prison walls; support a world of movements from the Black Freedom Struggle to the Hawaiian sovereignty movement; build autonomous networks; publish outside of mainstream channels; and expand radical imaginations. The affective nature of zines can be understood as love letters to the friends, family, community and networked computational devices of whom and which we share a world. Zines are integral in the way we both understand and construct the world we exist in. But like any other love letter, our efforts to be earnest are often reliant on the limitations of language and other violent systems of control which have a hold on our imagination or capacity for self-expression. In this workshop we will problematize the historical role that zines have played in DIY (do it yourself) culture and code our own web zine as an exercise of abolition and continued commitment to struggleâ€”whether in expressing ourselves in the next love letter or ending violent systems of punishment and enslavement. This workshop is organized and facilitated by Neta Bomani for the Digital Love Languages class taught by Melanie Hoff at the School for Poetic Computation.
